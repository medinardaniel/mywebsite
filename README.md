## Hosting and Deployment

The website is hosted and deployed using Vercel, a cloud platform for hosting static and serverless websites. Vercel provides a seamless deployment experience with features like automatic scaling, preview deployments, and custom domains.

### Deployment Process:
- Code changes are automatically deployed to Vercel when pushed to the main branch.
- Vercel integrates with GitHub Actions for seamless CI/CD pipelines.
- Each deployment is versioned and can be easily rolled back if needed.
